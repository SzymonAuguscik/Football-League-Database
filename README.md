# Football-League-Database
## PostgreSQL database of fictitious players and clubs with GUI made in Java
### Introduction
Combining my two passions of football and computer science, I've decided to create an app - a database with graphical interface. I have invented 16 names of clubs from various European capital cities and almost 400 players with "quasi-typical" for their countries fore- and surnames. My goal is to prepare SQL file that sets database containing those clubs and players and write program that will let users visualise the data.
### Work schedule
Stage 1
Draw scheme of relational database
Stage 2
Implement database in SQL
Stage 3
Fill that database with essential records
Stage 4
Create GUI
### Progress
Stage 1 - DONE
I have created database scheme using Dia. It consists of four relations - teams, players, games and stats.
